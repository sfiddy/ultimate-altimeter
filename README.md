### What sensors are used? 
*The SparkFun Altitude/Pressure Sensor Breakout* device employs a MEMS pressure sensor that outputs Pressure/Altitude and Temperature data. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, or MEMS are tiny machines that are composed of micro-sized elements. A MEMS sensor gather informations from their surroundings while a MEMS actuator executes specific commands based off the parameters set from the data gathered by a MEMS sensor.
