### What kind of data is this device collecting?
The i<sup>2</sup>C Precision Altimeter (also known as the SparkFun Altitude/Pressure Sensor Breakout) is an arduino controlled sensor that provides accurate accurate Pressure/Altitude and Temperature data.

### What sensors are used? 
*The SparkFun Altitude/Pressure Sensor Breakout* device employs a MEMS pressure sensor that outputs Pressure/Altitude and Temperature data. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, or MEMS are tiny machines that are composed of micro-sized elements. A MEMS sensor gather informations from their surroundings while a MEMS actuator executes specific commands based off the parameters set from the data gathered by a MEMS sensor.

### Where is the data being stored? 

The data is stored within the registers of the Altimeter. There are 3 storage modes available:
* Polling - 
* Interupt - New data is overrides any data in the register when an event determined by the programmer occurs. 
* FIFO - the unit periodically captures data in set intervals determined by the programmer. 

#### Possible Wireless transmission

The data collected from the Altimeter is accessed through an I<sup>2</sup>C serial interface and can be sent wirelessly with the help of an added component, the *Electric Imp*. Using this WiFi enabled development platform (*"Electric Imp"*), the data collected from the Altimeter will be transmitted wirelessly to [ide.electricimp.com](https://ide.electricimp.com)

### Is the data available to the user, and if so, in what format?

### How far can you trace the path of the data? 
![Electric Imp Data path](/images/ElectricImp_DataPath.png)
If transmitting the data wirelessly using the *Electric Imp*, the data is first sent either to the BlinkUp mobile app, or the Imp Cloud. 

### How far can you trace the physical development of the device, its materials and manufacture?
